# Simon-game
The Simon Game is a popular electronic memory game from the 1980s, where players need to remember and repeat a sequence of colors. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Game Layout:

The game has four colored buttons (usually red, green, blue, and yellow).
Each button can light up and plays a unique sound when pressed.
Gameplay:

The game starts by lighting up one button at random. The player needs to press the button that was lit.
After each correct response, the game adds an additional step to the sequence, lighting up the first button and then a new one.
The sequence keeps growing with each level, and the player needs to remember the exact order to advance.
Objective:

The objective is to remember and correctly repeat the sequence as it grows longer. If the player presses the wrong button or forgets the sequence, the game ends.
Difficulty:

The game becomes increasingly challenging as the sequences grow longer and harder to remember.
